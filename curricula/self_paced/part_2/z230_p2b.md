Part 2b - First Python Package Cont
--------------------------------------
This is intended to pick off right after part 2a - 
you had just created a separate readdata, printing, 
and computation module to remove redundant code 
blocks from your scripts.

There are many different libraries of code you can import 
and use. We are only going to teach you the most commonly 
used libraries, and one at a time in order to reduce any 
confusion you may have about what each library offers.

18. [python] Add a function for calculating dew 
    point temperature to your `computation.py` module:

    Now calculate dew point temperature. The 
    formula for this is:
    
        Gamma = log(Humidity) + (b * Temperature) / (c + Temperature)
    
        DPT = c * Gamma / (b - Gamma)

    Where DPT represents Dew Point Temperature in 
    Degrees C, Humidity is in %, Temeprature is in 
    degrees C, a = 6.112 mbar, b = 18.678, and 
    c = 257.14 degrees C.

    In order to do a natural logorithm, we will 
    need to import our first external module: math.

    Then write the function:
    
    ```python
    import math

    def compute_dewpoint(temp, hum):
        """
        Compute the dew point temperature given the temperature and humidity

        Parameters:
                temp: The temperature in units of F
                humL: The relative humidity in units of %
        """

        tempC = (temp - 32) * 5 / 9 #F to C
        rh = hum / 100
        
        a = 6.112 #mbar
        b = 18.678
        c = 257.14 #degC

        gamma = math.log(rh) + (b * tempC) / (c + tempC)
        tdp = c * gamma / (b - gamma)

        tdp_F = 9 / 5 * tdp + 32 # convert C to F
        return tdp_F
        ```

18. [git] Add and commit `computation.py`
   (`git commit -m "Function for Computing DPT"`)

19. [bash] Make a copy of your second script:
   
   ```bash
   $ cp windchillcomp.py dewpointtempcomp.py
   ```

20. [git] Add and commit `dewpointtempcomp.py`
   (`git commit -m "Creating a 3rd Script or DPT calculation"`)

21. Edit `dewpointtempcomp.py` 

    Make changes to the import statements to include:

    ```python
    from computation.py import compute_dewpoint
    ```

    And change your columns and types to include `dewpt`:

    ```python
    #columns names and column indices to read
    columns = {'date':0 , 'time':1, 'tempout':2, 'humout':5, 'dewpt':6}

    #data types for each column (only if non-string)
    types = {'tempout':float, 'humout':float, 'dewpt':float}
    ```

    And finally, make changes to the function call and print statements:

    ```python
    #calculate dewpointtemp
    dewpointtemp = [compute_dewpoint(t, h) for t, h in zip(data['tempout'], data['humout'])]

    #Output comparison of data
    print_comparison('DEW PT', data['date'], data['time'], data['dewpt'], dewpointtemp)
    ```

22. [git] add and commit
    
    ```bash
    commit -m "Computed dew point temperature"
    ```

23. Learn more about the math module!

    Hopefully since you already imported code from 
    your readdata, printing, and computation modules, 
    importing from an external module `math` seemed 
    a little less intimidating.

    You only used the `math.log` function, but some 
    other common methods within `math` include:
    
        `math.pi` which is the value of pi
        `math.tan(x)` which returns the tangent of x radiance
        `math.radians(x)` which converts angle x from degrees to radians
        `math.log10()` which returns the base-10 logarithm of x
    
    Just to name a few.

    You can read more about this module here:
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html

==========================

That concludes the second lesson of this virtual 
tutorial Part 2. 

You should now be familiar with importing external modules
and some methods within the `math` module - specifically 
the log method.
