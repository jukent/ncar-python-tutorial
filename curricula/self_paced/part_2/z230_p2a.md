Part 2 - First Python Package
-----------------------------

In this section we will learn how to move common
code blocks into Python modules and packages that
you can import into your complicated analysis 
methods easier to 
write and read.

Perhaps you are already familiar with importing packages into 
your workflow. In IDL people pass around files that contain 
unique user-written functions -  which achieves this same 
purpose of reducing the amount of redundant work between 
scientists, but in Python package managers help you know what 
version of those functions you are using. Matlab also has packages 
that you can pay extra money to install and use - again Python 
is free! 

Part 2a - 
---------------------------------------

Welcome to part 2. In this section you will continue 
learning Python

Open a terminal to begin and make sure you are in the 
NCAR_python_tutorial_2020 directory.

1. [bash] Make a copy of your first script with a new name:
   
   ```bash
   $ cp windchillcomp.py heatindexcomp.py
   ```

2. [git] And add and commit this new file.
   (`git commit -m "Copying first script to start second"`)

3. [python] Now you will compute the Heat Index.

    Like windchill, which is a measure of how much 
    colder the weather feels to the human body due 
    to windspeed, heat index is a measure of how 
    much hotter the weather feels to the human body 
    due to humidity. The Rothfusz formula for heat 
    index is:

    HI = a + (b * Temperature) + (c * Humidity) + 
        (d * Temperature * Humidity) + 
        (e * Temperature^2) + (f * Humidity^2) + 
        (g * Temperature^2 * Humidity) + 
        (h * Temperature * Humidity^2) + 
        (i * Temperature^2 * Humidity^2)

    where HI is the Heat Index, Temperature is in degrees F, 
    Humidity is in %, a = -42.379, b = 2.04901523, 
    c = 10.14333127, d = 0.22475541, e = 0.00683783, 
    f = 0.05481717, g = 0.00122874, h = 0.00085282, and 
    i = 0.00000199. The Roothfusz regression is not valid for 
    extreme temperature or hummidity conditions.

    Replace the `compute_windchill` function with
    a `compute_heatindex` function:
   
   ```python
   # Compute the heat index
   def compute_heatindex(temp, hum):
       a = -42.379
       b = 2.04901523
       c = 10.14333127
       d = 0.22475541
       e = 0.00683783
       f = 0.05481717
       g = 0.00122874
       h = 0.00085282
       i = 0.00000199

       rh = hum / 100

       hi = a + (b * temp) + (c * rh) + (d * temp * rh) 
       + (e * temp^2) + (f * rh^2) + (g * temp^2 * rh) 
       + (h * temp * rh^2) + (i * temp^2 * rh^2)
       return hi
   ```
   
   Change the columns we read from the data file to 
   get humidity and the correct heat index values:
   
   ```python
   columns = {'date': 0, 'time': 1, 'tempout': 2, 'humout': 5,
              'heatindex': 13}
   ```
   
   and specify in our types `dict` that we want `floats`:
   
   ```python
    types = {'tempout': float, 'humout': float, 'heatindex': float}
   ```

   Update the rest of the script to match
   
   ```python
   # Let's actually compute the heat index
   heatindex = []
   for temp, hum in zip(data['tempout'], data['humout']):
       heatindex.append(compute_heatindex(temp, hum))

   # Output comparison of data
   print('                ORIGINAL  COMPUTED')
   print(' DATE    TIME  HEAT INDX HEAT INDX DIFFERENCE')
   print('------- ------ --------- --------- ----------')
   for date, time, hi_orig, hi_comp in zip(data['date'], data['time'], data['heatindex'], heatindex):
       print(f'{date} {time:>6} {hi_orig:9.6f} {hi_comp:9.6f} {hi_orig-hi_comp:10.6f}')
   ```
   
   Run this script and see the results. 

   So in this step you have quickly revisited all of 
   the concepts from part 1 but no new concepts were 
   introduced. Please reach out if this was too quick.

4. [git] Stage and commit this new script.
   (`git commit -m "Updating new heat index script"`)

5. [bash] Now, you have two scripts that do very 
    similar things. In fact, all of the data reading 
    and parsing code is duplicated! And the output is 
    similarly formatted, too.  
   
   Create a new file called `readdata.py`:
   
   ```python
   def read_data(columns, types={}, filename="data/wxobs20170821.txt"):
       """
       Read data from CU Boulder Weather Station data file
       
       Parameters:
           columns: A dictionary of column names mapping to column indices
           types: A dictionary of column names mapping to types to which
               to convert each column of data
           filename: The string path pointing to the CU Boulder Weather
               Station data file
       """

       # Initialize my data variable
       data = {}
       for column in columns:
           data[column] = []

       # Read and parse the data file
       with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:

           # Read the first three lines (header)
           for _ in range(3):
               datafile.readline()

           # Read and parse the rest of the file
           for line in datafile:
               split_line = line.split()
               for column in columns:
                   i = columns[column]
                   t = types.get(column, str)
                   value = t(split_line[i])
                   data[column].append(value)

       return data
   ```
   
   In doing so, you have moved your common code, 
   the function for reading the file from both the 
   windchill and heatindex file to its own file.

    And you've made some changes to the function, 
    most notably we've introduced keyword arguments - 
    when you see types={} it means that types is 
    presumed to be an empty dictionary if you don't 
    specify it (and so you don't have to specify it 
    every time you call the function when this 
    keyword isn't relevant). 
    
    Similarly you've specified a filename that is used 
    as long as the user doesn't specify a different 
    file. Keyword arguments also can be called in any 
    order.

    Another change to youur function is the inclusion 
    of a docstrings. The "Read data from CU Boulder 
    Weather Station data file" describing the utility 
    of the function and the list of parameters are 
    standard information included in a docstring.

    This new file is a *module*. Modules are simply 
    files containing Python code, meantto be called 
    up within a different Python script.

6. [git] Stage and commit this new file
   (`git commit -m "Adding new readdata module"`)

7. [python] Amend your two Python scripts by first 
    deleting the equivalent read-file code in them.
   
   Then, add the following import statement to the 
   top of each script:
   
   ```python
   from readdata import read_data   
   ```
   
   And finally, after the initializations of the 
   `columns` and `types` variables, replace the 
   deleted code with a function call.
   
   ```python
   # Read data from file
   data = read_data(columns, types=types)
   ```
   
   Test out both of these scripts to make sure they 
   still work!
   
   In python you can call up functionality from 
   scripts outside of your active script using the 
   'import' statement. Here we import our read_data 
   function from the readdata module. And now we can 
   call up the function from these scripts. This 
   looks cleaner!

8. [git] Do a `git status` now.  Do you notice 
    something new?  Running our new scripts created the 
    `__pycache__` directory.  
   
   What is `__pycache__?
   When you run a python program with an `import` 
   command, Python learns that you have written code 
   that you may call again. The interpreter compiles 
   your scripts to bytecode and stores them in a cache, 
   making your scripts run a little faster next time. 
   As a user can for the most part ignore this new folder. 
   If you change or delete your scripts they will be 
   recompiled and reappear in this folder.

   However, you *don't* want to add this directory to 
   our project repository, so before you commit 
   anything, tell git to ignore it!
   
   Create a new file (in the top-level directory 
   of your project) called `.gitignore` with the 
   following contents:
   
   ```text
   __pycache__/
   ```
   
   Do another `git status`.  What do you see?
   
   Now, instead of `__pycache__` being listed as 
   "untracked", you see `.gitignore` being listed as 
   "untracked"...and no mention of `__pycache__`.
   
   Stage and commit the new `.gitignore` file.
   (`git commit -m "Ignoring pycache"`)
   
   Finally, do another `git status`.  Notice that
   the edits you made to your two scripts have still 
   not been committed tothe project repository!  
   Because they weren't staged before the last
   commit.
   
9. [git] Stage *both files* and commit all new 
    changes in one commit
   (`git commit -m "Refactor scripts to use new module"`)

10. [python] There is still have some duplicated 
    code in the two scripts.  Namely, the final 
    output code is mostly the same. 
   
   `Create another module file called `printing.py` 
   with the followingcontents:
   
   ```python
   def print_comparison(name, date, time, original_data, computed_data):
       """
       Print a comparison of two timeseries (original and computed)

       Parameters:
           name: A string name for the data being compared. (Limited
               to 9 characters in length)
           date: List of strings representing the dates for each data element
           time: List of strings representing time of day for each data element
           original_data: List of original data (floats)
           computed_data: List of computed data (floats)
       """

       print(f'                ORIGINAL  COMPUTED')
       print(f' DATE    TIME  {name.upper():>9} {name.upper():>9} DIFFERENCE')
       print(f'------- ------ --------- --------- ----------')
       for date, time, orig, comp in zip(date, time, original_data, computed_data):
           print(f'{date} {time:>6} {orig:9.6f} {comp:9.6f} {orig-comp:10.6f}')
   ```

   the only new functionality shown here is 
   `string.upper()`, which capitalzes all lower case 
   letters in a string
   
   Edit the two scripts to use this new module 
   (similar methods to step #7) Test your results.
   
   Try to do this on your own first, but if you are 
   getting error messages the solution looks like:
  
   1.  Add the `from printing import print_comparison` 
   line to the top of each script

   2. Replace the printing output section at the bottom
   of each script with:
   
   ```python
   print_comparison('WINDCHILL', data['date'], data['time'], data['windchill'], windchill)
   ```
   
   or
   
   ```python
   print_comparison('HEAT INDX', data['date'], data['time'], data['heatindex'], heatindex)
   ```

11. [git] Stage all changes and commit (`git commit -m "Creating printing module"`)

12. [python] You now have 2 different modules related 
    to the same project.  It is best practice
    to separate different functions into different 
    modules depending upon the kind of functionality 
    they represent.  In this case, you've separated 
    out the concepts of "data input" and "printing 
    output" into different modules.
    
    Do the same thing with the computation functions, 
    `compute_windchill` and `compute_heatindex`.
    
    Move these functions into a new module called 
    `computation.py`, and modify the scripts to use 
    this new module.  Remember to add docstrings!
    
    Try to do this on your own first!!
    
    
    
    
    Your new `computation.py` module should look 
    similar to the following:
   
    ```python
    def compute_windchill(temp, windspeed):
        """
        Compute the wind chill factor given the 
        temperature and wind speed

        NOTE: This computation is valid only for 
        temperatures between -45F and +45F and for 
        wind speeds between 3 mph and 60 mph.

        Parameters:
            temp: The temperature in units of F
            windspeed: The wind speed in units of mph
        """

        a = 35.74
        b = 0.6215
        c = 35.75
        d = 0.4275

        v16 = windspeed ** 0.16
        wci = a + (b * temp) - (c * v16) + (d * temp * v16)
        return wci


    def compute_heatindex(temp, hum):
        """
        Compute the heat index given the temperature and the humidity

        Parameters:
           temp: The temperature in units of F
           hum: The relative humitidy in units of %
       """

        a = -42.379
        b = 2.04901523
        c = 10.14333127
        d = 0.22475541
        e = 0.00683783
        f = 0.05481717
        g = 0.00122874
        h = 0.00085282
        i = 0.00000199

        rh = hum / 100
    `
        hi = a + (b * temp) + (c * rh) + (d * temp * rh) 
        + (e * temp^2) + (f * rh^2) + (g * temp^2 * rh) 
        + (h * temp * rh^2) + (i * temp^2 * rh^2)
        return hi
    ```
   
    And then modified the scripts accordingly.

13. [git] Stage and commit everything 
    (`git commit -m "Creating computation module"`)

14. [python] Now, you've got quite a few Python 
    files in the main directory.Which ones are scripts?  
    Which ones are modules meant to be imported?
   
    Typically, you should group all of the modules 
    meant for import only into another directory called 
    a *package*.  A *package* is a directory, often 
    with an `__init__.py` file inside it.
    
    Create a new directory called `mysci` and 
    create an empty file in it called `__init__.py`:
    
    ```bash
    $ mkdir mysci
    $ cd mysci
    $ touch __init__.py
    $ cd ..
    ```
    
    Then, move 3 modules into this package:
    
    ```bash
    $ git mv readdata.py mysci/
    $ git mv printing.py mysci/
    $ git mv computation.py mysci/
    ```
    
    Then, let's modify the import statements at the 
    top of our two scripts so that the modules are 
    automatically imported from the new package:
    
    ```python
    from mysci.readdata import read_data
    from mysci.printing import print_comparison
    from mysci.computation import compute_heatindex
    ```

15. [git] Stage everything (don't forget the 
    `__init__.py` file!) and commit 
    (`git commit -m "Creating mysci package"`)
   
    Our commits are getting bigger, but that's okay.  
    Each commit corresponds to a *single* 
    (conceptually) change to the codebase.
   
    With this last change, our project should look 
    like this (ignoring the
    `__pycache__` directories:
   
    ```text
    NCAR_python_tutorial_2020/
    
        data/
            wxobs20170821.txt
            
        mysci/
            __init__.py
            readdata.py
            printing.py
            computation.py
            
        heatindexcomp.py
        windchillcomp.py
   ```

16. [python] As a brief aside --
    look at the use of the computation
    functions in these scripts.  
    
    In the case of the wind chill factor computation,
    it looks like this:
   
    ```python
    windchill = []
    for temp, windspeed in zip(data['tempout'], data['windspeed']):
        windchill.append(compute_windchill(temp, windspeed))
    ```
    
    This divides the initialization of the `windchill` 
    variable as an empty `list` from the "filling" 
    of that `list` with computed values.
    
    Python gives you some shortcuts to doing this 
    via a concept called  "comprehensions", which 
    are ways of initializing containers (`list`s,
    `dict`s, etc.) with an *internal loop*.  For 
    example, we could have written the previous 3 
    lines in the form of a "one-liner" like so:
    
    ```python
    windchill = [compute_windchill(t, w) for t, w in zip(data['tempout'], data['windspeed'])]
    ```
    
    This is a *list comprehension*, and it 
    initializes the entire list with the computed 
    contents, rather than initializing an empy list 
    and appending values to it after the fact.  
    Computationally, this is actually *more efficient*.
    
    Use list comprehensions to make the computation 
    steps in both of scripts one-liners.

17. [git] Stage and commit changes 
    (`git commit -m "Using list comprehensions"`)

==========================

Okay that concludes the first lesson of this virtual 
tutorial Part 2. 

You should now be familiar with modules, using the 
import statement, some more f-string formatting options,
 __pycache__, gitignore, __init__, and list 
 comprehensions.

Please continue to part 2b.
